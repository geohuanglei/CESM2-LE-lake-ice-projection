# CESM2-LE-lake-ice-projection
codes for calculating and producing Figures in Nat Comm paper (Huang et al., 2022)
these are codes for calculating ice phenology from daily lake ice thickness data in CESM2-LE output (data available at https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/community-projects/LENS2/), and for producing figures in the article published in Nature Communications.
